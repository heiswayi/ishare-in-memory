FIRST OF ALL, many thanks for supporting Ishare from the beginning until today!

It's sad to be true that starting from today, IsharePortal has been shut down forever and the project has been discontinued. As I expected, the establishment of Ishare since the last three years in February 2010 will have its own pros and cons. However, within those periods, the objective of Ishare has been achieved which is to gather all sharerlinks in one place and also providing a medium for the community to interact each other. Perhaps, today it's time for the name 'Ishare' to be buried and becomes a history.

I, Wayi, the Founder of Ishare and also the one who involved directly in maintaining the IsharePortal, year after year, evolution after evolution and together has been assisted by Pirates_Killer as the Co-Founder of Ishare, now are no longer be responsible for the development of Ishare. Controversy after controversy, the name 'Ishare' rises up as a hot issue especially when it involves in these following topics; Internet, sharing and PPKT. We hope that one day, there will be people who have a new idea or better solution to continue the project like the Ishare - to provide a platform for students community sharing.

Thank you once again!

"When we share - that is poetry in the prose of life." --Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)

"Happiness is not so much in having as sharing. We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give." --Norman MacEwan (1881-1953)
